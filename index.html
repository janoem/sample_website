    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
    <p>
          Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
          <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
          command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
          everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
          Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
          We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
          learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our
          movement, <a href="http://learnenough.com/email">sign up for our official email list</a> now.

<h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>
<p>

     When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
     on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
     interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
     interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

<h3>Nick Merwin</h3>
<p>

     You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
     Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
     at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
     tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.

               <span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago–never mind how long
               precisely–having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
               particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a
               little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of
               driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
